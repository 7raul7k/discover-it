            <p>JavaScript continues to reign supreme and Python held steady in the second place position over the past year in large part due to its versatility in everything from development to education to machine learning and data science. TypeScript also held firm in fourth place year-over-year.</p>

       <h3>JavaScript</h3>
       <img src="../../../images/js.png">
       <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat</p>

        <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>

        <p>JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.</p>
        <p>The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.</p>
        <p>Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.</p>

        <h3>Why is calling JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: “LiveScript”. But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would help.</p>

        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>

    </section>
       <h3>How does HTML work?</h3>
       <p>HTML is usually stored in files that use the .htm or .html extension. A website can include hundreds or even thousands of these HTML files kept in various directories.</p>
